'''Administrators''' are editors who have the extra ability to:
*Block and unblock other users
*Delete and undelete pages on the site
*Protect and unprotect pages
*Edit pages in the MediaWiki namespace (e.g., [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]])
*View deleted edits of a page
*View any contributions by a user to pages which are deleted.

For a list of all Administrators on Test Wikipedia, see [[Special:ListUsers/sysop]].

===== Becoming an administrator =====
Administrator rights can be requested at [[Wikipedia:Requests/Permissions]]. A [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]] will decide on the request then. Candidates should meet the following requirements:
#Be active and trusted on other projects and preferably be a sysop elsewhere, or
#Demonstrate a need for the access (e.g. developers).
